If customers visit your home for services, you can list your full address.

Google allows home-based businesses on Google Business Profile as long as you meet customers in person."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What information do I need to list my business online?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "At minimum you need your business name, address or service area, phone number, business category, and hours of operation. For the best results, also prepare a business description, 10-20 photos, your website URL, a list of services with descriptions, and payment methods accepted. Having this information ready before you start makes the process much faster."}}

<h1>How to Get Your Business Listed Online Free</h1>

<p style="color:#999;font-size:14px">Published February 28, 2026 &bull; 16 min read &bull; by <a href="https://monkey.directory/">MonkeyDirectory</a></p>

<p>Getting your business listed on online directories is the fastest way to start appearing in local search results without spending any money. Every listing you create is a signal to Google and other search engines that your business exists, is located where you say it is, and provides the services you claim. The more consistent listings you have across trusted platforms, the more visible you become.</p>

<p>The best part is that the most impactful business directories are completely free. Google Business Profile, Yelp, Bing Places, Apple Maps, and Facebook all offer free business listings that reach billions of users. You do not need a marketing budget to get found online. You need 2-3 hours of focused effort and the information in this guide.</p>

<p>This guide walks you through every free business listing platform worth your time, in priority order, with step-by-step instructions for each one.</p>

<h2 id="prepare">1. Prepare Your Business Information First</h2>

<p>Before creating any listings, prepare a standardized set of business information that you will use identically across every platform. Consistency is critical for local SEO. Having "123 Main Street" on one listing and "123 Main St" on another creates an inconsistency that weakens your online presence.</p>

<p>Prepare the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Business name</strong> (exact legal or doing-business-as name)</li>
<li><strong>Street address</strong> (full format, chosen and consistent)</li>
<li><strong>Phone number</strong> (local number preferred)</li>
<li><strong>Website URL</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hours of operation</strong> for each day of the week</li>
<li><strong>Business description</strong> (150 words and 300 words versions)</li>
<li><strong>Business category</strong> (primary and secondary)</li>
<li><strong>Photos</strong> (at least 10: exterior, interior, team, products/services)</li>
<li><strong>Payment methods accepted</strong></li>
<li><strong>Year established</strong></li>
<li><strong>Service area</strong> (if you travel to customers)</li>
</ul>

<p>Save this information in a document that you can copy from when filling out each directory listing. This prevents typos and formatting differences that create citation inconsistencies.</p>

<h2 id="google">2. Google Business Profile (Most Important)</h2>

<p>Google Business Profile is the single most important free listing you can create. It directly controls how your business appears in Google Search and Google Maps, which together account for over 90 percent of search traffic.</p>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to business.google.com and sign in with a Google account. Use a business email on your own domain if possible, or create a new Gmail for your business.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click "Add your business to Google." Enter your exact business name. If Google suggests a matching listing, claim it. If your business is not found, click "Add your business" to create a new listing.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select your primary business category. This is the most important field in your entire listing. Choose the most specific category that matches your business. "Italian Restaurant" is better than "Restaurant."</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add your address. If customers visit your location, enter your full street address. If you go to customers instead, select "I deliver goods and services to my customers" and specify your service area.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter your phone number and website URL. Use the same phone number you will list on every other directory.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Complete verification. Google will walk you through the verification process, typically video verification in 2026. Follow the instructions to record a video showing your business exterior, signage, and interior.</div>

<div class="step-box"><strong>Step 7:</strong> After verification, complete every remaining field: business hours, description, services, attributes, photos, and opening date. A 100 percent complete profile ranks significantly better than a partial one.</div>

<h2 id="yelp">3. Yelp Business Listing</h2>

<p>Yelp is the second most important business listing platform. With over 178 million unique monthly visitors, Yelp listings frequently appear on page one of Google for business-related searches, giving you an additional search result beyond your own website.</p>

<p>Go to biz.yelp.com and click "Manage my free listing." Search for your business. If Yelp already has an auto-generated listing for your business, claim it. If not, click "Add your business" to create a new one. Complete your profile with all business information, photos, hours, and a compelling business description. Yelp's free listing includes unlimited photo uploads and the ability to respond to reviews.</p>

<p>Yelp will aggressively upsell their paid advertising. You can safely ignore all paid upgrade prompts. The free listing provides full SEO value including the citation, profile visibility, and the ability to manage your reputation through review responses.</p>

<h2 id="bing">4. Bing Places for Business</h2>

<p>Bing processes approximately 1 billion searches per day and powers search for Yahoo, DuckDuckGo (partially), and voice queries through Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa. Setting up Bing Places takes about 10 minutes because you can import your Google Business Profile directly.</p>

<p>Go to bingplaces.com and sign in with a Microsoft account. Select "Import from Google Business Profile" and authorize the connection. Bing will pull your business name, address, phone, categories, hours, and photos directly. Review the imported data for accuracy, make any needed corrections, and submit. Verification is usually instant when importing from Google.</p>

<h2 id="apple">5. Apple Maps via Apple Business Connect</h2>

<p>Apple Business Connect lets you manage how your business appears on Apple Maps, Siri, Safari, Wallet, and other Apple apps. With over 2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, your Apple Maps listing reaches a massive audience.</p>

<p>Go to businessconnect.apple.com and sign in with an Apple ID. Search for your business and claim your listing, or create a new one. Add your business information, photos, logo, hours, and a description. Apple's verification process involves phone or email confirmation. Once verified, your listing appears across all Apple platforms.</p>

<h2 id="facebook">6. Facebook Business Page</h2>

<p>Facebook has over 3 billion monthly active users, and its business pages carry a domain authority of 96, making them one of the strongest citation sources available. Your Facebook Business Page also serves as a social proof platform where customers can leave recommendations and reviews.</p>

<p>From your personal Facebook account, go to facebook.com/pages/create. Choose the "Business or brand" option. Enter your business name and category. Add your address, phone number, website, and hours. Upload a profile photo (your logo) and a cover photo (your business exterior or a branded image). Write a detailed About section with your business description, using the same text you prepared earlier.</p>

<h2 id="linkedin">7. LinkedIn Company Page</h2>

<p>LinkedIn's domain authority of 98 makes it one of the most authoritative sites on the internet. A complete LinkedIn Company Page provides a strong citation and professional credibility. From your personal LinkedIn account, click "For Business" and then "Create a Company Page." Enter your business details, add your logo, and write a comprehensive description that includes your services and service area.</p>

<h2 id="nextdoor">8. Nextdoor Business Page</h2>

<p>Nextdoor is uniquely valuable for local businesses because its 80 million members are organized by verified neighborhood. Recommendations on Nextdoor carry exceptional weight because members are real people at real addresses in your actual service area.</p>

<p>Go to business.nextdoor.com and claim your free business page. Add your business information, photos, and a description. You can post updates, respond to recommendations, and engage with local community discussions. The free tier includes your business page and the ability to post two free business posts per month.</p>

<h2 id="others">9. Additional Free Directory Listings</h2>

<p>After completing the major platforms above, add your business to these additional free directories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow Pages (YP.com):</strong> Free basic listing with business info, photos, and hours.</li>
<li><strong>MapQuest:</strong> Free listing that appears in MapQuest navigation and search. Submit at mapquest.com.</li>
<li><strong>Foursquare:</strong> Free business listing at business.foursquare.com. Foursquare data feeds into hundreds of apps.</li>
<li><strong>Hotfrog:</strong> Free business directory with descriptions and contact details.</li>
<li><strong>Manta:</strong> Free listings for small businesses with company profiles and reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Alignable:</strong> Free business networking and directory for small businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Chamber of Commerce directories:</strong> Many local chambers offer free or low-cost directory listings to members and non-members.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optimize">10. Optimizing Your Free Listings for Maximum Visibility</h2>

<p><strong>Complete every field.</strong> Directories reward complete profiles with higher visibility. Do not leave optional fields blank. The more information you provide, the better your listing performs in search results and the more useful it is to potential customers.</p>

<p><strong>Use high-quality photos.</strong> Listings with photos receive dramatically more engagement than those without. Upload at least 10 photos across your major listings. Show your business from multiple angles, your team, your products or services, and your work.</p>

<p><strong>Write unique descriptions.</strong> While your core business information should be identical across platforms, consider slightly varying your description text to avoid exact duplicate content across dozens of sites. Adjust the tone and focus while keeping the factual information consistent.</p>

<p><strong>Select accurate categories.</strong> Every platform uses categories to match businesses with search queries. Choose the most specific categories available. Using broad categories means competing with more businesses for the same visibility.</p>

<h2 id="maintain">11. Maintaining Your Listings Over Time</h2>

<p>Creating listings is not a one-time task. You need to maintain them to keep them accurate and effective.</p>

<p><strong>Update hours immediately</strong> when they change for holidays, seasonal adjustments, or any other reason. Inaccurate hours lead to negative reviews and lost customers.</p>

<p><strong>Respond to reviews</strong> on every platform within 24-48 hours. Review response rate is both a ranking factor and a customer trust signal.</p>

<p><strong>Add new photos monthly.</strong> Fresh visual content signals that your business is active and well-managed. Aim for at least 5 new photos per month on your Google Business Profile.</p>

<p><strong>Audit quarterly.</strong> Check all your listings every three months. Look for unauthorized changes, incorrect information, and duplicate listings. Directories sometimes auto-generate duplicate listings from data aggregator feeds, and these need to be merged or removed.</p>
